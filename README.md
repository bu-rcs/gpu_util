# Plans
* Preliminarily: output format CSV (unless output gets very large)
* Visualization of results
  * What kinds of visualization
  * May be different for different users (queue owners, RCS staff, individual users)
* Interactive visualization
* Inputs: (User, queue, compute node), time period, multi-GPU, OOD (interactive) vs batch, fully idle jobs
